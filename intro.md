This page is a very simple static HTML site which uses Javascript on the client side to fetch information about all
websites which I host via github pages.  I've lately decided that being able to host single page, static HTML sites
(perhaps augmented with Javascript functionality) that can be a simple application can be useful.  These will all 
be hosted at various urls pointing to [mvandewettering.com](https://mvandewettering.com).   As I add additional
pages of this sort, they will all be linked here automatically.  

Most of this code will have been written with the help of Gemini CLI.
